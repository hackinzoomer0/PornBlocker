# Porn Blocker Chrome Extension
The porn blocker Chrome extension lets you automatically blur images on your active tab if the Moderate Content AI thinks that it's "adult" - and in only 12 lines of code!

This could be pretty useful if you're a streamer who likes to browse the internet on-stream or something like that. Just remember that it doesn't work for videos, or for sites like Omegle.

Also, just a heads up, it takes a bit to send the images to the AI and process them, so blurs aren't immediate.

## Usage
1. Go to `Manage Extensions` in your browser.
2. Click `Load Unpacked`
3. Choose the directory with this file in it.
